# Swedish Motor Insurance – Case Study Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes regional claim data from a Swedish motor insurance portfolio to support data-driven premium pricing strategies. Using SAS for data wrangling and Tableau for visualization, we explore claim frequency, severity, and cost by geographic zone and recommend premium multipliers aligned with risk.

## Tools & Technologies
- SAS (for data cleaning and aggregation)
- Tableau (for visualization and dashboarding)
- Microsoft Word (for case study reporting)

## Key Business Questions
- What zones have the highest average cost per policy?
- Where are claims most frequent?
- Which zones have high frequency and severity?
- What premium multipliers are appropriate based on risk segmentation?
- How can we visualize zone-level performance to support pricing decisions?
